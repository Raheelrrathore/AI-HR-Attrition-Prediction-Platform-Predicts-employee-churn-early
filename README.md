# AI-HR-Attrition-Prediction-Platform-Predicts-employee-churn-early
This project employs a machine learning-based HR analytics system to forecast employee attrition (churn) risk based on historical workforce data. The purpose is to assist firms in identifying employees at risk of leaving early and implementing data-driven retention initiatives.The system is designed as a complete AI prototype.

What to expect?
This project demonstrates a working AI prototype for predicting employee attrition risk using machine learning.
When using this project, you can expect:
A trained Logistic Regression model that learns attrition patterns from real HR data
Probability-based predictions (not yes/no guesses) indicating attrition risk
An interactive web interface where different employee profiles produce different risk scores
Clear differentiation between low, medium, and high attrition risk
Input validation to prevent unrealistic or invalid employee values
A simple and explainable ML approach rather than a black-box model

How to execute the code?
To execute the code TRY Run all on google colab 
to use the interactive web interface 
run the last code 
although it will only work for 1 week as its purpose is to showcase the applicability of the model for educational purpose 
the applicability of the model could also be visualized by mean of recorded video you can find the link to the video below :
